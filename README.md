## Customizing Configuration

Edit `_data/site_info.yml` and `_data/site_styles.yml` for site configuration. Update `baseurl` in `_config.yml`. For navigation/menu customization, update nav.html and sidebar.html.

## Tagging System 

The toolkit has a tagging system, allowing you to categorize factsheets based on five key criteria: 'Signature Solutions', 'Enablers', 'RBLAC Priorities', 'TAGS' and 'SDG'.


### How to Use Tags

To utilize this tagging feature, you can include the following configuration in your toolkit:

```yaml
# CONFIGURATION BELOW IS ONLY NEEDED IF YOU WANT TO USE TAGS AND CATEGORY IN THE TOOLKIT

signature_solutions: [ Poverty and Inequality, Governance ]
enablers: [ Digitalisation ]
rblac_priorities: [ Pillar 1 Inclusive and Sustainable Growth ]
sdg: [ 1 No Poverty ]
tags: [ Policy, Governance ]
```

These tags are optional. If no tags are used within your toolkit, the tagging and filter-by-tag features will not be present. However, if any of the tags are used, the corresponding filters will be dynamically added to your toolkit.

Once you add any of these tags to your factsheets, the corresponding sidebar and dropdown filters for these tags will automatically appear. You can preview a sample of this feature in the training toolkit.

That's it! You're ready to create, customize, and deploy your Toolkit site. Have fun documenting and sharing your content!
